<br><br>

## 📍 Problem Statement
Many advert companies create adverts that are linked to different apps and sites. <br>
Whether or not a person would click on the ad cannot be determnied naturally, hence might be a waste of the ad and might lead to great loss to the company.
<br><br><br>


## 📍 Objective 
The aim of this project is to build an AI solution that uses machine learning algorithms predict whether or not a user would click an ad or not.
<br><br><br>

## 📍 Data
The dataset was in a tabular (CSV) format and was gotten from a research studies, which was subsequently cleaned and wrangled in preparation for machine learning.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Skills and Technologies

* Programming (Python, JavaScript)
* Data wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
* Data Analysis and Visualization. (Numpy, Stat, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Machine/ Deep learning (Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, XGBoost)
* Backend (Flask)
* Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
* Cloud deployment (Render, Heroku)

## 📍 Notebook
#### This Jupyter notebook containing some exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Ajisco/Ad-Click/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb) <br><br><br>

## 📍 App Features
1. Has a section to fill form to collect data of the user.
2. Machine learning predicts whether or not the user clicks an advert.
3. Web app compatible by every device. <br><br><br>




## 📍 DEPLOYMENT 🚀

#### This app is deployed at [Render](https://render.com/)
	
#### You can access it [Here](https://adclick.onrender.com/) <br><br><br>


## 📍 Limitations
1. The dataset used was not large enough and can't be said to have generalized well despite the high metric values.
2. The app starts slowly due to the free cloud service used (Render). <br><br><br>

## 📍 To improve
1. I would love to improve the dataset in size and quality.
2. I would love to add an NLP algorithm that considers the name or topic of the advert while doing the prediction.
<br><br><br>
