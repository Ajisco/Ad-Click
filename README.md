## 📍 Problem Statement
Many advert companies create adverts that are linked to different apps and sites. <br>
Whether or not a person would click on the ad cannot be determnied naturally, hence might be a waste of the ad and might lead to great loss to the company.
<br><br><br>


## 📍 Objective 
The aim of this project is to build an AI solution that uses machine learning algorithms predict whether or not a user would click an ad or not.
<br><br><br>

## 📍 Data
The dataset was in a tabular (CSV) format and was gotten from a research studies, which was subsequently cleaned and wrangled in preparation for machine learning.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Skills and Technologies

* Programming (Python, JavaScript)
* Data wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
* Data Analysis and Visualization. (Numpy, Stat, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Machine/ Deep learning (Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, XGBoost)
* Backend (Flask)
* Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
* Cloud deployment (Render, Heroku)

## 📍 Notebook
#### This Jupyter notebook containing some exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Ajisco/Sami-Depression/blob/master/Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb) <br><br><br>

## 📍 App FEATURES 
1. Has a section to fill form of syptoms and data.
2. Machine learning diagnoses the depression and classifies it.
3. There is an option to pick a song genre of choice.
4. An algorithm was used to provide a song list (from Youtube music API) that connects the depression type and the music genre of choice.
2. Has a link to a site for more information.
3. Web app compatible by every device. <br><br><br>




## 📍 DEPLOYMENT 🚀

#### This app is deployed at [Render](https://render.com/)
	
#### You can access it [Here](https://sami.onrender.com/) <br><br><br>


## 📍 Limitations
1. The dataset used was not large enough and can't be said to have generalized well despite the high metric values.
2. The app starts slowly due to the free cloud service used (Render) 
3. Some musics are gyet to be added  and app might not contain all genres of musics yet. <br><br><br>

## 📍 To improve
1. I would love to improve the dataset in size and quality.
2. I would love to add more musucs and do more research to link the other genres of music.
<br><br><br>
